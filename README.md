# Can Counting Program using OpenCV

This repository hosts a Python program that leverages the OpenCV library to count the number of cans present in an image. The program utilizes computer vision techniques to identify cans within the provided image and then displays the count of detected cans.

## Introduction

The Can Counting Program demonstrates an automated approach for tallying the quantity of cans within an image. By employing the OpenCV library, the program streamlines the process of can counting, which can be particularly beneficial in situations where manual counting is time-consuming or prone to errors.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. To use the program, provide the path to the input image within the `can_counting.py` file:

   ```python
   input_image_path = 'path/to/your/input/image.jpg'
   ```

3. Run the program using the following command:

   ```
   python can_counting.py
   ```

4. The program will process the input image, detect cans, and display the count of cans found.
